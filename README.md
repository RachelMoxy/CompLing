# CompLing
Computational linguistics project using text analysis and regex to analyze patterns of harassment on social media

GOALS

This project aims to use a data-driven computational linguistics approach to investigate harassment on 
social media, with a use-case of prototyping a formal linguistic model for identifying online harassment 
that can be used by social media companies to accurately identify harassing behavior that may be in 
violation of their use policies.  
The principal questions this analysis aimed to address are: how do we define harassment on social 
media? what is the prevalence of harassment? how can a computational linguistic model identify 
harassment? what are the advantages and  shortcomings of such a model? 

SUMMARY

In general, this analysis found that the prevalence of harassment is significant in reddit comments (2.1%), 
and although the moderators are demonstrating a fair amount of activity, it is insufficient to catch all the 
instances of harassing behavior.  A rules-based classifier can narrow the instances of text likely to be 
harassing with some efficacy, but has barriers to accuracy as presented by a) the variable meanings of 
the same tokens in different contexts b) the unusually creative linguistic environment of the digital sphere, 
and social media in particular. Further, defining harassment as separate from other types of inappropriate 
behavior such as discourtesy, insult and hate presents a challenge for a computational model that cannot 
account for connotation as well as a natural speaker.  
It is important to note that although the instances of harassment may seem low, there is a high degree of 
discussion surrounding the effects of harassment on the community. For example, one comment from the 
current dataset simply reads: 
IS NO THREAD SAFE? 
Capturing the notion that the effects of harassment are amplified by the discussion of these instances, 
and its effect on the perception of community safety. Even though these behaviors are targeted, they 
have a ripple effect on everyone who uses the platform.
